**CorrugatedIron** has been live in the public domain for over three months already. During this time we've had a mixture of feedback from various sources which has been key in us choosing a direction for the software for each of the releases. This information is unfortunately scattered in various locations and isn't really digestable by the general public.

We thought we'd best solve that problem by kicking off a blog and discussing the issues and design decisions in the one spot. With a bit of luck, those people looking for this kind of information will have no trouble finding it and we'll have a great place to foster discussion which will continue to help us guide CorrugatedIron in the right direction.

Watch this space, our first _real_ post will be coming shortly.
