Sometimes things don't go as well as planned. That's software development. So what should you do when you're using <strong>CorrugatedIron</strong> and you have problems? What's the best way to get help?

Use the Riak Mailing List
-------------------------
The [Riak mailing list][ml] is by far the best way to get help for a number of reasons:

* [Jeremiah][] and [OJ][] live at opposite ends of the planet and run their own businesses. Time zones play havoc with support and schedules are full. Contacting either or both of us directly via email, or Twtitter, doesn't mean you'll get the fastest response.
* There are other CorrugatedIron users on the mailing list who might be able to help you.
* If your question hasn't been asked before, then other people on the list will benefit from the answers that are provided.
* Answers to your questions are archived in a public place, allowing for other people to discover those answers down the track using Google.
* While it might not appear so, many questions that you think are related to CorrugatedIron are actually specific to Riak. The mailing list has many Riak experts with more experience than Jeremiah and OJ, and as a result you're more likely to get a faster resolution.

Both Jeremiah and OJ are subscribed to the mailing list and are constantly watching for CorrugatedIron-related posts. If you post there, they <em>will</em> see it.

So make sure you post to the [mailing list][ml], it really is the best place to get help.

Need Support?
-------------

Jeremiah and OJ are availble should you require paid support. The best thing to do this case is to [email us directly][email] to discuss your needs and to figure out a plan of attack. We look forward to hearing from you!
