Why "CorrugatedIron"
--------------------

Before [Riak][] was called Riak, it was called _Ripple_. [Basho][] changed the name to Riak prior to it's first release (I think). _Riak_ is the Indonesian word for _Ripple_.

When we first kicked this project off we knew we were attempting to bring together Riak and .NET, so we wanted a name which was in some ways indicative of both of the technologies. _Ripple_ was an obvious component, and given that .NET was involved we thought we'd stick to the MS approach of using the word _iron_ for things related to .NET. [CorrugatedIron][definition] is just a real-life representation of what happens when _iron_ and _ripples_ meet!

So that's where the name comes from.
